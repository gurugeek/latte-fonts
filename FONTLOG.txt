# FONTLOG for the Latte font

This file provides detailed information on the Latte font Software.

This information should be distributed along with the Latte fonts and any derivative works.

## Basic Font Information

Latte is a modification of Google's Carlito fonts. The stylistic alternate "g" is now the default one on bold and regular weights. 

Carlito is based on Lato fonts by Łukasz Dziedzic (http://www.lukaszdziedzic.eu/), changing the metrics to match Microsoft's Calibri.
