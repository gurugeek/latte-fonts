### Carlito

Carlito is based on Lato fonts by [Łukasz Dziedzic](http://www.lukaszdziedzic.eu/).

There are few modifications from Lato:
* Matches Microsoft's Calibri metrics.
* Some ligatures: fi, ffi, fj, ffj, fì, ffì.
* Additionnal and slighty different alternates: €, $, £, etc.
* Less weights: Regular & Bold, when Lato has also Heavy, Black, Medium, Semibold, Light, Thin and Hairline.
* Less glyphs: 2000+ glyphs vs 3000+ glyphs per style for Lato. Carlito covers Latin-BasicGreek-BasicCyrillic (same as Calibri), Lato covers 100+ Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages, Greek and IPA phonetics.

### Why this name ?

I don't know where the name Carlito come from, but I think it is from the genus of the [Philippine tarsier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_tarsier) in order to match the Colibri/Calibri theme.

Nevertheless, Carlito is based on Lato, which means *summer* in Polish. Łukasz Dziedzic chose this name because "the semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. Male and female, seri­ous but friendly. With the feel­ing of the Sum­mer." ([Source](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/))

So I wanted a name which reminds the "serious but friendly" part. A [latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte) is both serious and friendly, and the reminder of the original Lato name is pretty obvious. Bonus: it comes *after* Lato alphabetically.
