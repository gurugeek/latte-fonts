# Latte

Latte is a modification of Google's Carlito fonts. I just wanted a modern version with some single-story *g*, so I fired up FontForge and here we are.

## List of modifications

* The stylistic alternate *g* is now the default one on bold and regular weights.
* Addition of the [irony point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony_punctuation) and the [interrobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang) because every great typeface deserves such misunderstood punctuations. The irony point is located at U+2E2E (REVERSED QUESTION MARK) as introduced by the Unicode standard 5.1 (2007), the interrobang is at U+203D (its inverted counterpart at U+2E18). Single-character versions of this glyph are also available at code points U+2048 (QUESTION EXCLAMATION MARK) and U+2049 (EXCLAMATION QUESTION MARK).
* Addition of the [basis point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point), at U+2031, in order to be hated by the BIPM.
* Addition of the [Copyleft symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#Symbol) at code point U+1F12F as [accepted by the Unicode Technical Committe](https://twitter.com/ken_lunde/status/730168010321760258).

## A word about hinting

There is no hinting on the OpenType fonts. The TrueType fonts, however, are autohinted using [ttfautohint](https://freetype.org/ttfautohint/).

## About

### Carlito

Carlito is based on Lato fonts by [Łukasz Dziedzic](http://www.lukaszdziedzic.eu/).

There are few modifications from Lato:
* Matches Microsoft's Calibri metrics.
* Some ligatures: fi, ffi, fj, ffj, fì, ffì.
* Additionnal and slighty different alternates: €, $, £, etc.
* Less weights: Regular & Bold, when Lato has also Heavy, Black, Medium, Semibold, Light, Thin and Hairline.
* Less glyphs: 2000+ glyphs vs 3000+ glyphs per style for Lato. Carlito covers Latin-BasicGreek-BasicCyrillic (same as Calibri), Lato covers 100+ Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages, Greek and IPA phonetics.

### Why this name ?

I don't know where the name Carlito come from, but I think it is from the genus of the [Philippine tarsier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_tarsier) in order to match the Colibri/Calibri theme.

Nevertheless, Carlito is based on Lato, which means *summer* in Polish. Łukasz Dziedzic chose this name because "the semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. Male and female, seri­ous but friendly. With the feel­ing of the Sum­mer." ([Source](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/))

So I wanted a name which reminds the "serious but friendly" part. A [latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte) is both serious and friendly, and the reminder of the original Lato name is pretty obvious. Bonus: it comes *after* Lato alphabetically.
